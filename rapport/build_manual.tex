\section{Building the solution}

The solution has been implemented in Java, version 1.6.

Source Files are in the sub-repository named "src". Compiled classes are supposed to go into "bin". You can find input and output examples in "data".

In order to build the solution, go in the root repository of the project. Then type the following instruction in a shell :
\begin{verbatim}
	javac -cp src/ -d bin/ src/Main/Dissasembler.java
\end{verbatim}
